# Brainstorm

- Autonomic computing: enable systems to become resilient
- Ways to make systems autonomic:
    - Design patterns in programming languages
        - Might need a specialised language for AC-purpose
            - Integrate with other langs (instead of SDKs)
            - Available via cloud platform
    - Architectures for diff levels of AC
- Challenges (turned benefits):
    - Knowledge bases (ontologies) that not everyone can collect manage [main reason]
        - More ppl use a centralised platform, more effective knowledge bases
    - Central place for community-based R&D (like DarkMatter)
        - More ppl use a centralised platform, more data collected for research
    - Economies of scale
    - Difficult to convert existing systems to AC
        - Plug-and-play type migration to AC
    - Difficult to build testing arch
        - Markhor
    - Heavy use of AI to support various parts of AC arch
        - Cloud platform absorbs complexity of customising, maintaining AI models
    - Cost estimation, pricing?
