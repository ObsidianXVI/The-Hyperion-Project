## Analysing Current Limitations

Let's analyse the pros and cons of current languages, and where they fall short in terms of AC needs. We will use the AIM theory to first list out needs and features of an Autonomic System:
- intelligence
    -  knowledge
        - processing ontologies
                - this is a pretty complex topic, and presents its own area of research under `research/knowledge/ontologies`
    - analysis
        - impact of actions
            - measurement, recording of how much goals/policies are met
            - health checks, (possible event-driven) reporting by individual components
        - create action plan
            - combine knowledge, awareness, engine to create plan
        - evaluation of plan's effectiveness
            - same as "impact of actions"
- awareness
    - goals, policies
        - readable by both human and computer
        - assessable by program
    - roles, relationships between diff elements
        - this topic also gets its own area of research under `research/awareness/relations-between-components.md`
    - monitoring
        - context
            - a mechanism to capture relevant context information
- mutability
    - different levels of autonomicity require diff levels of mutability
    - hot-swapping components while preserving state
    - separating state from action
