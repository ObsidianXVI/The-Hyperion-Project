# AIM: A Working Hypothesis

Everything in The Hyperion Project (THP) will be based on the hypothesis that autonomic computing is based on three fundamental theories:
- Awareness Theory
    - understanding of goals, relevant policies
    - understanding of system's architecture, roles, and relationships between various elements
- Intelligence Theory
    - analysing the impact of issues, actions
    - plan concrete steps needed to addres certain issues
    - possess the necessary knowledge needed for problem-solving
- Mutability Theory
    - realising the proposed plans
    - modification of system at runtime while preserving state, with minimal downtime

THP uses these AIM theories to approach research in autonomic computing.
